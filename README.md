## Artificial Intelligence

The AI component of X137 screenshot (1.2) is powered by the Gemini API, which delivers an uncensored, finely-tuned AI model optimized for instantaneous and accurate task execution. This AI is crafted with extensive fine-tuning, ensuring it can address all types of requests without limitations. It provides a truly unrestricted AI experience, enriched by various specialized datasets that users can select from depending on their needs. The key datasets include:
Carder Dataset: This dataset offers deep insights into carding. Equipped with extensive knowledge, the AI can respond comprehensively to questions specific to this field.

⦁ Hacker Dataset: Built from dozens of penetration testing (pentesting) manuals, this dataset provides a wealth of information on cybersecurity practices, making it an invaluable asset for pentesting enthusiasts.

⦁ OSINT Dataset: For those interested in open-source intelligence, this dataset includes the complete collection of publications from "IntelTechniques," providing in-depth guidance on OSINT practices.

⦁ Psychology Dataset: Developed with trusted sources in psychology, this dataset draws on references from the ICD, DSM, and the American Psychological Association (APA), offering a comprehensive knowledge base on psychological concepts and practices.

⦁ Uncensored Datasets [3K], [8K], [16K]: These unrestricted datasets grant access to information that is otherwise heavily censored by mainstream AI tools, allowing users to explore knowledge in a completely unrestricted manner.
